	<p><b>Optimizing Modalities for Exosuit Training in Chronic Stroke Survivors (2025-2026)</b></p>
	<p><b>PI: Sangwon (Eric) Shin</b> - Funding by American Heart Association (AHA) (25PRE1378622)</p>
	<p>Stroke survivors often encounter significant challenges with walking, such as uneven gait patterns and impaired balance control. While many rehabilitation programs primarily focus on motor recovery, our project aims to address a critical gap by developing a novel exosuit designed to enhance walking symmetry. This lightweight, wearable device provides gentle support to the legs and is intended for home-based rehabilitation. To optimize its effectiveness, we will investigate two key exercise modalities: training on different surfaces (treadmill versus overground) and the impact of interval versus continuous exosuit use. If proven effective, findings could identify the most effective methods for using the exosuit to enhance mobility in stroke survivors</p>

	<p>Comparison of Walking Training on Overground versus on a Treadmill with an Asymmetric Exosuit in Healthy Adults</p>
	<p>Pi: Sangwon (Eric) Shin - Funded by Graduate Research and Creative Acitivity (GRACA) Grant (2024)</p>
	<p>Our team has developed an asymmetric exosuit to modify gait symmetry, similar to a split-belt treadmill. This exosuit aims to improve gait rehabilitation for post-stroke patients by increasing the error (i.e., longer step would be longer, shorter step would be shorter). This project compared the effectiveness of the exosuit in two different walking conditions (Overground versus. Treadmill) in healthy adults before using for stroke survivors. </p>
